# Using a Camera and Hand Gestures to Control a Game with Python
In this project, we will be using a camera and machine learning model to detect and classify hand gestures in order to control a simple game implemented in Python.

The main components of this project are:

- action.py: This script uses the camera to capture images of the user's hand and passes them through a machine learning model to classify the hand gesture. The script then sends the appropriate command to the game based on the detected gesture.
- model: This file stores the machine learning model that is used to classify the hand gestures.
- snake.py: This script contains a sample game implemented using the Pygame library. The game is a simple version of the classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake to move around the screen and collect food.
- controlgame.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook combines the above scripts to create a complete program that allows the player to use hand gestures and the camera to control the Snake game.

## Installing Packages from a requirements.txt File in Python
One of the easiest ways to manage the packages that your Python project depends on is to use a requirements.txt file. This file lists all the packages that your project needs, along with their version numbers, so that you can easily install all the required packages with a single command.

In this tutorial, we will be installing the following packages:
```
opencv-python
opencv-contrib-python
fake-keyboard
pygame
```
To install these packages, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. If you don't have them already, you can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/) and install it, or use your system's package manager to install Python and pip.

2. Create a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. This file should contain a list of all the packages that your project depends on, one per line. For example:
```
opencv-python
opencv-contrib-python
fake-keyboard
pygame
```
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.

4. Run the following command to install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the required packages and their dependencies. You should now be able to import and use these packages in your Python scripts.

Note: If you need to install a specific version of a package, you can specify the version number in the requirements.txt file by using the == operator. For example:

Copy code
opencv-python==4.4.0
This will install the exact version of opencv-python that is specified.
  
To run the program, first ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Then, start the Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions provided to start the game and begin using hand gestures to control the snake.
